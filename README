There are many notepad apps for Android. But this one is better.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Application core is under <project>/app directory


Required dependencies:

[lib project] Android Support v7 appcompat (r18)
	<project>/appcompat

[lib] Android Support v4 (r18)
	<project>/appcompat/libs/android-support-v4.jar

[lib] Joda-Time (v2.3)
	<project>/app/libs/joda-time-2.3.jar


Or simply use Gradle build it!
